# RBD_EEGpattern
## This repository contains two Python scripts (ipynb) and one Matlab script for deriving and evaluating EEG patterns.   

1. part1_PC pattern and score.ipynb (Python)
2. part2_best pattern by logistic regression.ipynb (Python)
3. part3_evaluation of pattern expression.m (Matlab)   

*** These three codes should be implemented sequentially. 
## For reference   
These codes were written as an example for the 'PD-RBD delta pattern'.   
These codes were utilized for extraction of EEG patterns and their evaluation on an independent test set.   
If applying the LOOCV method, please refer to the paper's explanation and adjust the code accordingly.   
Additionally, the Python scripts includes output for the shape of matrices at intermediate stages.
